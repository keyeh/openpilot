# RexPilot ü¶ñ

RexPilot is my personal fork of the OpenPilot driver assistance system, designed to reduce distractions and noise. Based on FrogPilot, it enables a quiet, screen-off driving experience, letting drivers use the instrument cluster instead, with improved integration for Toyota and Lexus vehicles.

**Added features:**

- Screen stays off in standby mode and will only turn on for alerts or taps.
- Integration with Toyota and Lexus instrument clusters
  - Left and right lane lines show what the driving model sees
  - LTA icon indicates lateral control status and when overriding steering.
  - Barrier graphic also indicates lateral control status
- Removed obnoxious "Reverse Gear" message.
- Restored original boot logo

**Planned features:**

- Default suggested settings
- Show the driving path if and only if lateral control is on
- Startup screen with OEM aesthetics
- Sound design with OEM aesthetics

Enter the following URL at installation where you choose "Custom Software (Advanced)". The first install may take over 10 minutes as the user interface is compiled on your device.

## Suggested settings

I suggest using these settings to have a quiet and peaceful drive:

- Screen Standby Mode: ON
- Screen Timeout (Onroad): 5 seconds
- Alert Volume Controller: set according to your preferences

## What is openpilot?

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models, and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).
